## 🌍 About This Project

The **Freedom From Spyware Scanner** is a secure, offline, cross-platform spyware detection tool that scans your system for some of the most dangerous spyware strains using lightweight, self-contained code — with **no cloud**, **no installation**, and **no tracking**.

This project is built for **privacy**, **clarity**, and **functionality** — with the core mission of helping people stay safe from malicious surveillance.

## 🙏 A Personal Yet Global Initiative

This project is born from direct personal experience.

After being **hacked**, I lost:
- 💸 My cryptocurrency savings  
- 💻 My Windows laptop  
- 🌐 My WIFI router  

The breach was made possible through a **compromised open-source library** used by a widely trusted cryptocurrency wallet (which I prefer not to name here). The injected malware would **scan the computer/device**, and if this wallet was present, it would silently launch an attack by recording keyboard activity (keylogger) and then through a hidden communications app relay this info back to some kind of intelligence center, which probably decoded user keyboard action via decoding software of some kind, and then when you revisit your wallet, suddenly it is empty. Horrific and real. Crime without consequences. 

Even a **professional antivirus solution** failed to detect it.

This project is my **response** — and my **redemption**.  
Not out of anger, but from a desire to protect others.  
So that no one else has to endure this pain.

This is not a company.  
This is a **donation-supported humanitarian effort**.

If you find this program helpful, please consider contributing to keep it going.  
As long as donations continue, development will continue.

Your support helps:
- Expand detection coverage  
- Improve compatibility and resilience  
- Reach more users who need protection

## ⚠️ Why It Is NOT Open-Source

Although open-source has great value, it was **through an open-source dependency** that attackers breached my system.

The damage was real:
- Financial loss  
- Equipment loss  
- Emotional and psychological distress  

Therefore, this project is **not open-source** by design. The code is carefully protected to ensure its integrity and to reduce the attack surface.

All you need to know is this:
- It is built with care  
- It does what it says  
- It exists to protect you

## 💻 How to Use

1. Download the executable for your platform (Windows, MacOS).  
2. Double-click and the freedom-from-spyware scanner program opens automatically in the Mac Terminal app / Windows DOS/Console app.  
3. Accept the disclaimer and then press Enter/Return to run the freedom-from-spyware scanner.  
4. Depending on your machine, the program might ask for permission to scan additional drives. Choose Yes to allow.  
5. The program takes less than a minute to run and complete its scan. Review any matches (spyware signatures found).  
6. Based on the results, you can decide what solution to use going forward.
7. Spyware, like Malware, is precarious. It is sometimes hard to remove/delete.
8. Please consult with a qualified cybersecurity professional if needed. 
9. Press Enter to exit safely.

No installation. No registry entries. No advertisements. No tracking.   
**Just you and your machine.**

## 🤝 Final Note from the Developer

This initiative is my way of:
- 🧠 Processing the trauma  
- 🧰 Fighting back in a meaningful way  
- ❤️ Giving back by protecting others  

In a world where threats are silent and constant,  
this scanner is my voice — and my vow — to help where I can.

If this program protects even one person — even **you** —  
then this mission has found its purpose.

Thank you.  
**Blessings to you all.**
