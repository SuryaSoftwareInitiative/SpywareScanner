## 🌍 About This Project

The **Freedom From Spyware Scanner** is a secure, offline, cross-platform spyware detection tool written in ANSI C. It scans your system for some of the most dangerous spyware strains using lightweight, self-contained code — with **no cloud**, **no installation**, and **no tracking**.

This project is built for **privacy**, **clarity**, and **functionality** — with the core mission of helping people stay safe from malicious surveillance.

## 🙏 A Personal Yet Global Initiative

This project is born from direct personal experience.

After being **hacked**, I lost:
- 💸 My cryptocurrency savings  
- 💻 My laptop  
- 🌐 Even my router  

The breach was made possible through a **compromised open-source library** used by a widely trusted cryptocurrency wallet (unnamed here). The injected malware would **scan devices**, and if the wallet was present, it would silently launch an attack.

Even a **professional antivirus solution** failed to detect it.

This project is my **response** — and my **redemption**.  
Not out of anger, but from a desire to protect others.  
So that no one else has to endure this pain.

## ⚠️ Why It Is NOT Open-Source

Although open-source has great value, it was **through an open-source dependency** that attackers breached my system.

The damage was real:
- Financial loss  
- Equipment loss  
- Emotional and psychological distress  

Therefore, this project is **not open-source** by design. The code is carefully protected to ensure its integrity and to reduce the attack surface.

All you need to know is this:
- It is built with care  
- It does what it says  
- It exists to protect you

## 🤝 Final Note from the Developer

This initiative is my way of:
- 🧠 Processing the trauma  
- 🧰 Fighting back in a meaningful way  
- ❤️ Giving back by protecting others  

In a world where threats are silent and constant,  
this scanner is my voice — and my vow — to help where I can.

If this program protects even one person — even **you** —  
then this mission has found its purpose.

Thank you.  
**Blessings to you all.**
